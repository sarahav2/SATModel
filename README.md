#The Input Page
===============

Users can choose from all of the currently provided CollegeBoard SAT Practice Tests in the navigation bar to be taken to the corresponding bubblesheet where they either complete it live as they take the test, or transfer their answers later.

Once the user hits the submit button, the test will be graded and the user redirected to the report.

The current version of the user report provides score data for all scaled, sub-, and cross-test scores. As we expand upon the app, additional scoring will be added.
